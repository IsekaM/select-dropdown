# Select Dropdown
This is an experimental, super mini project that I did for experimental purposes. I was working on this project and I saw a dropdown menu on the site I was working on using the `<select>` tag in HTML. So I thought of building a burger menu using the select tag. I know the idea isn't original but what the hell! I had fun experimenting. 

**Fun Fact:** `<select>` tags don't work with the before and after psuedo elements. Who knew?! Apparently not me ðŸ˜ª
